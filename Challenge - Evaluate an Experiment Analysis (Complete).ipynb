I would then repeat this experiment for many different types of prisoners captured from many different planets to determine which slogan is most effective overall.\n"

I would then track the rise in activity levels of only users who use the app daily (or a certain number of times weekly depending on the data) to ensure that the data collected from each user is representative.
