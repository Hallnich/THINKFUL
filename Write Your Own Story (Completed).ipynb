    "   While I am still figuring out exactly what I want to do with my career, I am very sure that I want to be doing something in some way related to the field of environmental science.  After this bootcamp I hope to be able to combine the skills I gained in topics such as python and machine learning with my prior experience working with spatial data in a number of software platforms such as ArcGIS and the NOAA HYSPLIT MODEL and apply this knowledge to some role working with large datasets of environmental data.  While the are a number of areas that I could see myself doing this, given my current experience with the subject and the availability of jobs in this area with organizations like NOAA, ESRI, and NASA  the area I will most likely specialize deeply in is atmospheric science or meteorology."

    "   My ideal job would involve taking data and images generated from satellites and using this information to answer specific questions.  While, I am very sure that I want to specialize somewhere in the field of environmental science, I am still unsure of exactly what skills I want to specialize in, although I am fairly certain that it will be some topic relating to atmospheric science or climate sciences.  After completing this course I will most likely try to work for some organization doing environmental consulting work or environmental remediation. "
